# Emphasis and Strong
<!-- 
TEST REASONING:
Emphasis formatting standardization is visible here. The serializer has normalized
the syntax, preferring underscores (_) for italics rather than asterisks (*).
This is acceptable because the semantic meaning and visual rendering are identical,
and standardizing on one syntax improves consistency throughout the document.
