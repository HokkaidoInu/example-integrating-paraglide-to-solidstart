# Heading level 1

<!--
TEST REASONING:
Notice how alternative heading syntax (using === or ---) has been converted to # syntax.
This is an acceptable transformation as it maintains the heading level while
standardizing on a single heading syntax. Also notice that emphasis markers in headings
have been normalized to use underscores for italics, consistent with the rest of the document.
