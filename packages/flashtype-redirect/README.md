# Flashtype Redirect

This is a simple HTML page to redirect users to the lix.host/app/flashtype/ URL. It is used to have an SEO-friendly URL for the flashtype.ai domain.

## Development

Use the Live Server Extension in Visual Studio Code to run the HTML file locally:

1. In VS Code, go to the Extensions panel (or press Ctrl+Shift+X / Cmd+Shift+X).
2. Search for Live Server by Ritwick Dey and install it.
3. Open your HTML file.
4. Right-click in the editor and choose "Open with Live Server".
5. Your default browser will open at a local address (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html).
