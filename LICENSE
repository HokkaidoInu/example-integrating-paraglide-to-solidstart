Every [package](./packages/) has their own license. 

Guidelines for choosing a license:

- [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) is chosen if the package is a library that developers should build upon.  

- [Fair Core License](https://fcl.dev/) is chosen if the package is an "end product" (app, website, host) that developers do not build on, and might be monetized in the future.
