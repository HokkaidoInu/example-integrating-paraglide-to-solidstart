## What is Inlang?

### Standard open file format for i18n

Inlang is an *open file format* for internationalization *i18n* that provides an [SDK](https://github.com/opral/inlang-sdk) for building and integrating localization tools on top of that open file format.

By defining a standardized file format for i18n, inlang enables interoperability between i18n solutions (translation management apps, developer tools, etc.).

### Stack agnostic

Inlang is a file format with no depedency on a tech stack. Hence, it can be used with any tech stack. 

The only thing that is needed are import/export plugins for the translation file format that is used by the tech stack. For iOS for example, the [XCode strings catalog](https://inlang.com/m/neh2d6w7/plugin-hechenbros-xcstrings) can be used. For Flutter a `.arb` plugin would be the right choice.

### SDK to build i18n apps & solutions

The inlang file format has an SDK that allows you to create, read, and query inlang files programmatically. Go to the [SDK docs](https://github.com/opral/inlang-sdk) for more information.
