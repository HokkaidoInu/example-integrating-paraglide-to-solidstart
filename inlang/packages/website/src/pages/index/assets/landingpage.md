## What is Inlang?

### Standard open file format for i18n

Inlang is an **open file format** for internationalization (**i18n**) that provides an **SDK** for building and integrating localization tools on top of that open file format.

By defining a standardized file format for i18n, inlang enables interoperability between i18n solutions (translation management apps, developer tools, etc.).

### SDK for building i18n solutions

The inlang file format has an official **[SDK](https://inlang.com/c/sdk)** that allows you to create, read, and query inlang files programmatically.

Go to the [SDK docs](https://github.com/opral/inlang-sdk) for more information.
