# Storage format

You can use any inlang plugin to store messages. 

<doc-callout type="info">
  Paraglide JS utilizes the inlang SDK, which is responsible for handling the storage of messages, making it easy to switch between different storage formats.
</doc-callout>

By default, Paraglide JS uses the [inlang-message-format](https://inlang.com/m/reootnfj/plugin-inlang-messageFormat) plugin. But, you can use any other plugin that suits your needs. Mixing & matching is also possible.
