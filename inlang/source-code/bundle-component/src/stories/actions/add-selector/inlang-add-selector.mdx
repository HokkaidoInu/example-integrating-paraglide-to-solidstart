# InlangAddSelector

The component is currently only used inside of the bundle. That means that it can't be slotted.

<Canvas of={InlangAddSelector.Example} />

#### Props:
- `message`: The message as Message
- `messages`: The messages as Message[] to get inputs

#### Event:
- `change`: The component dispatches a change event that contains all necessary information.
- `submit`: The component dispatches a submit event.

> The event bubbles up, so you can have a change event listener on a higher level.
