# InlangVariant
 
The InlangVariant component shows a single variant of a message. (Example: "`count` products" is a variant of the message "en"). The variants of a message get matched with selectors and corresponing matches.

## Plain usage

The component consists out 3 parts. A main text editor that shows the pattern (slotted pattern editor), the matches that are editable and different kind of actions and additional information on the right side.

#### Props:
- `variant`: The variant includes the pattern (we need some variant information to dispatch a meaningful event)
 
<Canvas of={InlangVariant.Example} />

#### Event:
- `change`: The component dispatches a change event that contains the variant information.

> The event bubbles up, so you can have a change event listener on a higher level.

#### Slots:
- `pattern-editor`: Is the main text editor that shows the pattern (use InlangPatternEditor component for that)
- `variant-action`: Slot Actions into the variant
## Usage in Messgae

The InlangVariant component is used in the message component. To achieve this you need to slot is as `variant`.
