# InlangPatternEditor
 
The InlangPatternEditor component is a rich text editor build on top of [Lexical](https://lexical.dev/). In the next weeks this component will get more features and will be more customizable.

## Plain usage

> Don't ever use the component in a Shadow DOM. It will not work.

#### Props:
- `variant`: The variant includes the pattern (we need some variant information to dispatch a meaningful event)

#### Event:
- `change`: The component dispatches a change event that contains the variant information. 

> The event bubbles up, so you can have a change event listener on a higher level.
